# 🧠 MSO5000 SCPI Doom Interface

Welcome to the **MSO5000 SCPI Doom Interface**, a terminal-based utility for interacting with your **Rigol MSO5000 oscilloscope** using SCPI commands — now powered by our freshly enhanced script: `doom.py`.

> Formerly known as `doom2.py`, the latest version is now cleaner, funnier, and way more pinky.

## ⚙️ Features

- 📡 Connect via **LAN or USB** to any MSO5000 scope

- 🧠 `pinky` mode: random **Brain & Pinky quotes** stream into your terminal
- 🎨 Colorful logging and improved debug output
- 📁 Modular: Quotes and learned SCPI commands stored in separate files
- 🧪 Interactive SCPI testing with fuzzy logic and command learning
- 🔒 Offline, secure — no dependencies beyond Python 3 standard library

## 🧠 Pinky & Brain Mode

Activate by running:

```bash
python3 doom.py pinky
```

This will stream random quotes like:

```
🧠 I think so, Brain, but if we didn't have ears, we'd look like weasels.
🧠 The same thing we do every night, Pinky... try to take over the world!
```

Each quote line has randomized colors and timings.
